### Brief Description
The Relational Shape Measure (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-021-01041-3) is a measuring method to measure the shape of an object or a group of objects as a function to the distance to some reference object. The method uses the Hausdorff measures of all possible intersections of the object and a parameterized dilation of the reference object. That is volume, outer surface area, the surface area of intersection, length of intersection contour.

### Use Cases
The method can answer questions like:
- Are the objects distributed more or less closely near the reference object.
- Are the objects larger or smaller near a reference object.
- Does the object have large facing surfaces towards the reference object.

### How to use it
To use the method it requires you to have vertices and faces for the two exterior measures and vertices and tetrahedra for the interior measures. It also requires the distance of each vertex to the reference object. These can be generated by something like mesh-to-point algorithms or interpolation from a distance field from a distance transform method. See the examples.py for a few examples on synthetic data.
