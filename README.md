# Relational shape measures of coagulating milk proteins
This project provides a novel approach to the study of casein micelle coagulation
during milk curdling through the application of spatial analysis methods


## Setup
1. Install dependencies
2. Import microscopy video of coagulating cheese to path `\images\`
3. Run notebooks

## Spacial image analysis
Run `demo.ipynb` with path to video.

## Optimize parameters for synthetic images
Rune `gradient_descent.ipynb` with path to video.
